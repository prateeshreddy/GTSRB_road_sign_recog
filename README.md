Convolution Neural Network for German Traffic Sign Recognition 


# Dataset
 
We use [GTSRB dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset#Downloads)
 * Single-image, multi-class classification problem
 * 43 classes
 * More than 50,000 images in total
 * Large, lifelike database
 * Reliable ground-truth data due to semi-automatic annotation
 * Physical traffic sign instances are unique within the dataset
